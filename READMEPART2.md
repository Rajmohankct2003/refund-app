# A well designed web application
1. A good website clearly answers "Who I am," "What I do," and/or "What can you (the visitor) do here." A website should be user friendly and its appearance should be good.
2. You never get a second chance to make a first impression -- that’s why your homepage is undoubtedly one of the most important web pages on your website.
For any given company, the homepage is its virtual front door. If a new visitor doesn't like what they see, their knee-jerk reaction is to hit the "back" button.
That's right -- unfortunately, a lot of people still judge a book by its cover.
3. Website must be secured otherwise there are lot of chances for hackers to do inject in the resources and it can lead to huge loss for the company.
4. A website should have a loading component to improve user experience. Loading symbol gives users a feeling of “Content will appear soon”. This is definitely better than keeping users wondering about the current status.
5. A websites should have a proper eror handling to guide the user whats wrong with the website.
6. Theme and performance of the website is very important.
7. The weird thing is that good design often takes a long time to pull off, but only a split second to recognise. We have the ability to look at a page and immediately determine whether it’s nice or not.
